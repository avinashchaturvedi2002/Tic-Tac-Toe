# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is my first project using these technologies. The game allows two players to play Tic Tac Toe on the same device, with features such as different colors for X and O, and a draw detection mechanism.

## Features

- **Two-Player Game**: Play against a friend on the same device.
- **Draw Detection**: The game detects and announces a draw if there are no more moves left and no winner.
- **Different Colors for X and O**: X and O are displayed in different colors to enhance visual distinction.
